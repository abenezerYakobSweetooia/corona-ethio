## EPIDEMIOLOGY

Patient Characteristics:

* Median hospitalized age varies by country and case report, mostly between 40s-70s ([**Wang et al**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=32031570), [**Arentz et al**](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763485))
* Initial male predominance but less clear as more data appears ([**Wang et al**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=32031570), [**Arentz et al**](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763485))
* Most patients with comorbidities, esp HTN, DM, CVD, chronic respiratory disease Incubation period: median 5-7 days, 98% within 12 days ([**Lauer et al**](https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2762808/incubation-period-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-from-publicly-reported), [**Tian et al**](https://www.journalofinfection.com/article/S0163-4453(20)30101-8/fulltext)) R0: around 2-2.5 in general population ([**WHO**](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200306-sitrep-46-covid-19.pdf)), up to 11 aboard cruise ships ([**Mizumoto & Chowell**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042720300063)) but can be lowered through distancing & public health controls Viral shedding: can be present 1-3 days prior to onset of symptoms, median duration 20 days with durations up to 37 days in recovered patients ([**Zhou et al**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171076/))

### Transmission:

* Transmission via droplet, contact (fomites up to 7hrs on some surfaces); unclear if airborne transmission but may be possible ([**van Doremalen et al**](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2004973)) Asymptomatic transmission appears to occur based on case reports ([**Bai et al**](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762028), [**Rothe et al**](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2001468)) and may be the source of a majority of infections based on modeling (Li et al)

### ISOLATION & PPE

* Current CDC, WHO, SCCM recommendations: contact and droplet for COVID+ and rule out; airborne if aerosolizing procedure
  * In influenza studies, surgical facemasks appear equivalent to N95 in respiratory infection prevention -- though N95 significantly better in vitro, pragmatic benefit unclear ([**Smith et al**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26952529/), [**Radonovich et al**](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2749214))
* All aerosolizing procedures (intubation, NIPPV, HFNC, suctioning, nebs, bronchoscopy, endoscopy, TEE) should be performed in negative pressure rooms ([**SCCM**](https://www.sccm.org/Blog/January-2020/Caring-for-Critically-Ill-Patients-with-Novel-Coro))
  * HFNC increases droplet spread and should be considered aerosolizing ([**Ne-Hooi et al**](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12630-020-01634-3))
  * Laparoscopy should be considered a potentially aerosolizing procedure and viral filters should be used, avoid ALL elective procedures ([**SAGES**](https://www.sages.org/recommendations-surgical-response-covid-19/))
  * Avoid aerosolizing procedures when possible
* [**University of Nebraska UV mask decontamination protocol**](https://www.nebraskamed.com/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19/n-95-decon-process.pdf)
* PPE Distribution Sites working to match HCWs needing PPE with people looking to donate: [**Get Us PPE**](https://getusppe.org/) [**Project N95 National COVID PPE Clearinghouse**](https://www.projectn95.com/) [**MaskMatch**](https://www.mask-match.com/)

#### Creative solutions as supplies run low:

##### 3D printing templates (not tested or validated, but likely better than nothing)

* [**Masks, face shields**](https://github.com/scaleworkspace/covid19)
* [**Dual filter masks**](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4232209)
* [**Face shields**](https://blog.prusaprinters.org/from-design-to-mass-3d-printing-of-medical-shields-in-three-days/)
* [**Face mask holders/frames**](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4141338) (maybe with vacuum bags/HEPA filters inside?)

#### Masks

Masks

N95s > surgical masks >>> homemade cloth masks > nothing against droplet transmission ([**MacIntyre et al**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4420971/?fbclid=IwAR0l8pDr_lbIc08Si_V0ArBf_7I-xunS1kb2MAfifS56Z9yiL2Aao6020yw#__ffn_sectitle), [**van der Sande et al**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440799/))

2015 large, prospective randomized control trial of cloth masks vs clinical masks. Relative risk of 13 for influenza-like illnesses in healthcare workers wearing cloth masks vs. standard clinical masks. ([**MacIntyre et al**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4420971/?fbclid=IwAR0l8pDr_lbIc08Si_V0ArBf_7I-xunS1kb2MAfifS56Z9yiL2Aao6020yw#__ffn_sectitle))

## CLINICAL FEATURES

### Symptoms

#### Adults

Fever (99% over 99F in one study, but up to 40% afebrile on admission in another), fatigue (70%), dry cough (59%), anorexia (40%), myalgias (35%), dyspnea (31%), sputum production (27%) ([**Wang et al**](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2761044), [**Leung et al**](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rmv.2103), [**Arentz et al**](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763485), [**Guan et al**](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2002032))

* Symptoms are highly variable and should generally have high index of suspicion for isolation and testing ([**Lynch**](https://edhub.ama-assn.org/jn-learning/audio-player/18315876))
* Look out for “silent hypoxemia” -- profound hypoxemia without respiratory distress ([**Xie et al**](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00134-020-05979-7))
* GI symptoms (abd pain, diarrhea, N/V) were rare in some case series but common (49%) in others; often preceded respiratory symptoms ([**Wang et al**](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2761044), [**Lei et al**](https://journals.lww.com/ajg/Documents/COVID_Digestive_Symptoms_AJG_Preproof.pdf))
* May present with anosmia per European reports, though unable to find original case reports ([**ENT UK**](https://www.entuk.org/loss-sense-smell-marker-covid-19-infection))
* ARDS present in all intubated patients [**Arentz et al**](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763485)
* Cardiomyopathy in ⅓ of patients ([**Arentz et al**](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763485), [**Ruan et al**](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-020-05991-x))
* Presence of shock highly variable (1%-35%) ([**SCCM**](https://www.sccm.org/Blog/January-2020/Caring-for-Critically-Ill-Patients-with-Novel-Coro))

#### Children

More variable -- most common cough (48%), pharyngeal erythema (46%), fever (42%) ([**Lu et al**](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2005073))

#### Pregnancy

Very little known, but very small (15) case series without clear difference in outcomes of mild disease or clear adverse impact on fetus/childbirth ([**Liu et al**](https://www.ajronline.org/doi/10.2214/AJR.20.23072))
